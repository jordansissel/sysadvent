When you're a sysadmin of several systems, you soon find yourself needing a
centralized `dashboard' (ugh, I hate that term) of sorts for your systems.
That is, a central monitoring point where, with one or two screens, you can
easily check on the overall health of ALL of your systems.   And yeah, it helps
when the same monitoring tool/suite notifies you 24x7 when something goes awry.
</p>
 
<p>
In this context, many product names are familiar: Nagios, Zenoss, Hyperic,
OpenNMS, but one that I personally feel that gets overlooked too often
is Xymon.
</p>

<p>
Historical note: Xymon is the current name of the project formerly known as
Hobbit. Due to a nastygram the project lead got from the Tolkien estate
some time ago, the project had to be renamed.
</p>
 
<p>
Anyhow, all of the above-mentioned products work well. Some are free, and
some are mostly free unless you wish to purchase support or perhaps value
add-ons. After trying most of them out, I settled on Xymon. Why? Because
it's simple, lightweight, flexible, scalable, and yeah, free. The
others - they're good, but I found them time-consuming to set up, and many of
the screens display "too much" for my liking.
</p>

If you've never seen Xymon, then please at least check out the online demo.
Go to <a href="http://www.xymon.com">http://www.xymon.com</a>.    You'll see a
simple screen with a few catagories, and colored icons.   (Green = good, yellow
= warning, red = bad).   Click on the icon next to "systems".   You'll see a
few servers listed, and lots of status icons.  Click on ANY of the status icons
for info.   Click on a CPU icon.  Once you've done that, scroll to the bottom.
Check out the RRD historical graph at the bottom#.  And click on it.    Whoa -
lots of history and trend info. 
</p>
 
<p>
After that 30 second demo, you will either say "feh", or you'll say "whoa--
this is pretty powerful, yet - simple". For the latter folks: read on.
</p>
 
<p>
Setting up Xymon is simple.    It's available as RPM's, or also <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hobbitmon/">source</a>.   I prefer
source.  Compiling it (follow the instructions) is straightforward. Your distro
may still use 'hobbit' as the package name.  I'm not going to go into how - my
goal is to show you the key configuration files that make Xymon work.  Hobbit
includes easy hooks into your local apache server.
</p>
 
<p>
The first file you want to configure is 
<a href="http://xymon.com/hobbit/help/manpages/man5/bb-hosts.5.html"><code>bb-hosts</code></a> 
(Why bb?  Hobbit..  er..  XYMON is an active branch of the older, less capable
"Big Brother" monitoring package). The <code>bb-hosts</code> contains the
systems you want to monitor. Put in a couple.   The first entry is the xymon
host itself (and is required).     The other two are two additional servers I
want to monitor. (see <a href="http://xymon.com/hobbit/help/manpages/man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts(5)</a>).
</p>
 
<pre>
# format is
# ip-address       hostname                # tag1 tag2 ...
192.168.1.10       xyhost                  # bbd apache=http://127.0.0.1/
192.168.1.1        system1
192.168.1.2        system2
</pre>
 
<p>
Once you get rolling, you can eventually categorize and group the Xymon display
page to your liking.   It's all a simple matter of editing
<code>bb-hosts</code> and following examples in there.
</p>
 
<p>
The next file is <a href="http://xymon.com/hobbit/help/manpages/man5/hobbit-alerts.cfg.5.html"><code>hobbit-alerts.cfg</code></a>. Put in an entry for connections
  (ping tests). Set it up to email to yourself:

<pre>
SERVICE=conn
  MAIL my.email@my.domain RECOVERED FORMAT=TEXT
</pre>
 
<p>
That one entry says, "any time a server is unreachable- email me- and also email me when it comes back.  Email me the full info.".
There's lots of flexibility here, have SOME server entries email you (or page
you) and some not, alerting on some services but not others, etc.  
</p>
 
<p>
That's it!   You now have basic monitoring.    Without anything installed on
clients - hobbit can remotely monitor things like uptime (ping test), http,
ftp, ssh, smtp, and a few others.     The power comes in when you throw up a
little hobbit client on each server.    Then, you'll have it all - cpu, memory,
disk - and the ability to download/customize or even write your own tests.
There's a ton of available modules you can add.   Build the client, and install
it on ONE of your additional servers above.   Make sure to allow the xymon port
(tcp 1984) into the xymon server.
</p>
 
<p>
When I set up a new server (we add stuff weekly) - one of my configuration
steps is adding it to the hobbit/xymon monitoring.    On the Xymon server side-
I add one text entry in bb-hosts.   On the client side (the new server), I
create a hobbit user account, grab the client tarball that I built and compiled
already- untar it - copy the init script, and I'm done.   Takes about a minute.
The client is VERY lightweight, and gathers data using simple available tools
like "top", "df", etc.
</p>
 
<p>
I like Xymon because it meets the "Gene Simmons" (*) principle.   It's simple,
it's effective.   All your sysadmin tools should be that way.
