<h1>Website Performance Optimization</h1>
<p><em>This article was written by <a href="http://www.completefusion.com">Bob Feldbauer</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/bobfeldbauer">@bobfeldbauer</a></em></p>
<p>Optimizing website performance can dramatically increase conversions and
loyalty, and decrease costs. Although it may be traditionally viewed as a
responsibility of developers, the reality is that sysadmins are also often
asked to work on website performance optimization. </p>
<p>The following is intended as a busy sysadmin's "crash course" in optimizing
website performance.</p>
<p>As with trying to optimize any process, you should establish a baseline to
measure any changes against. Install the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>
Firefox plugin and Yahoo!'s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a> add-on
to measure your initial performance and verify improvements as you make
changes. To see performance changes over time from a consistent external
source, you can use free tools like Pingdom's <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/">Full Page
Test</a> or Octagate's
<a href="http://www.octagate.com/service/SiteTimer/">SiteTimer</a>. Also, <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google's
Webmaster Tools</a> shows optimization
suggestions based on the <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/">Page Speed</a>
tool, and crawl stats for the average time spent downloading a page from your
site.</p>
<p>Yahoo!'s
<a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/28/performance-research-part-1/">research</a>
shown in the table below shows 62-95% of the time required to load a page is
spent making HTTP requests for non-HTML components like images, scripts, and
stylesheets. See the following table for the time spent loading HTML vs
non-HTML components for popular websites:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th> Site </th>
    <th> Time Retrieving HTML </th>
    <th> Time Elsewhere </th>
  </tr>

<tr>
    <td> Yahoo! </td> 
    <td> 10% </td>
    <td> 90% </td>
  </tr>
    <td> Google </td> 
    <td> 25% </td>
    <td> 75% </td>
  </tr>
    <td> MySpace </td> 
    <td> 9% </td>
    <td> 91% </td>
  </tr>
    <td> MSN </td> 
    <td> 5% </td>
    <td> 95% </td>
  </tr>
    <td> eBay </td> 
    <td> 5% </td>
    <td> 95% </td>
  </tr>
    <td> Amazon </td> 
    <td> 38% </td>
    <td> 62% </td>
  </tr>
    <td> YouTube </td> 
    <td> 9% </td>
    <td> 91% </td>
  </tr>
    <td> CNN </td> 
    <td> 15% </td>
    <td> 85% </td>
  </tr>

<p>As the table indicates, reducing the number of HTTP requests can provide one
of the biggest increases in performance. Aggregating CSS and JavaScript into as
few files as possible and using <a href="http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/">CSS
Sprites</a> are two ways to reduce the number
of HTTP requests.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing the number of HTTP requests, being able to load
scripts in parallel instead of serially can improve performance. A newly
developed tool called <a href="http://headjs.com/">Head JS</a> can be used to load
JavaScript scripts in parallel, while retaining execution order. This allows
scripts to load without blocking other components from loading.</p>
<p>Most sites include static files that change infrequently (CSS, images,
JavaScript, etc) and can benefit from appropriate HTTP caching. See the
Google's Page Speed team's <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html">guide to HTTP caching</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Another important step in website performance optimization is configuring your
web or application server to deliver gzip compressed content. On <a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/18/18-2t.html">typical
sites</a>, gzipping
content reduces text size by 75% and total size by 37%.</p>
<p>In addition to gzip compression, making images, scripts, and CSS files smaller
also helps - especially when loading a site on lower bandwidth connections
like mobile devices. Even if you gzip scripts or CSS files, you can "minify"
them to further reduce their size by 5% or more. Yahoo!'s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">YUI
Compressor</a>
can minify both CSS and JavaScript, while Yahoo's
<a href="http://www.smushit.com">Smush.it</a> can optimize image sizes without losing
quality.</p>
<p>Although there are many other things you can do to optimize website
performance, this "crash course" in optimization should get you started.</p>
