<h1>Jails</h1>

<i>This article was written by <a href="http://www.atarininja.org/">Wesley Shields</a></i>

<p>The first day of SysAdvent talked about Linux Containers (LXC), and how they
are an "operating system level virtualization", as opposed to "platform
virtualization" choices like Xen or VMWare. Today, I'll focus on jails in
FreeBSD and how they achieve a similar goal.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>If you think of a traditional OS it looks something like this:</p>

<img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_u-5lMShiO40/TQc1Tt-cm9I/AAAAAAAAAGs/0UXezGSG2uk/regularOS.jpg">

<p>Among other things, the kernel controls access to hardware, makes sure
processes are not stomping all over each other's memory, does the necessary
access control checks for actions, and also ensures that packets land at the
appropriate sockets. However, even if everything is perfect, a sufficiently
privileged process can cause a lot of havoc if it misbehaves.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a process running as root that gets compromised and is
now running arbitrary code of the attacker's choosing. Typically, this comes
in the form of a shell listening on a socket, or a connect-back shell; both
of which are very bad. Through this arbitrary execution of code, the attacker
can do whatever he/she is allowed to through the access controls in place.
In most cases (where things like mandatory access controls are not in place)
this is effectively game over for the system administrator.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, I should probably explain how jails are different
from what most people are familiar with. To be consistent with the earlier
article I'll call it "platform virtualization." That solution looks something
like this:</p>

<img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_u-5lMShiO40/TQc1TToQ6KI/AAAAAAAAAGk/eOXao_KMA2g/vm.jpg">

<p>There are different approaches but it is essentially the same goal.  Insert
a small "virtual machine monitor" (VMM) layer - often called a hypervisor -
that brokers access to the real hardware and emulates whatever hardware the
systems administrator wants to the OS running on top of it. Modern chips
have support for helping do this in hardware (AMD calls it "AMD-V" and Intel
calls it "VT-x"). Just about every chip shipping now has this built in.</p>

<p>"Platform virtualization" has many benefits to it. You can choose what
hardware to provide to the guest operating system. The VMM is hopefully
small enough that it can be properly secured and verified. Finally, you
can decide which operating system to run as the guest. The fact that it is
virtualized should be transparent - with the exception of needing driver
support for whatever hardware is emulated, which every major OS has support
for.</p>

<p>There are some drawbacks to this approach. It can be very resource intensive
as the more virtual machines you spin up the more hardware and state has to
be kept in memory. With modern hardware this is becoming less of a problem,
but, for some environments, it may still hold true.</p>

<h2>Enter Jails</h2>

<p>Jails are best thought of as a means to contain and isolate processes
from each other, even if those processes are privileged.</p>

<img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_u-5lMShiO40/TQc1TbJ0LeI/AAAAAAAAAGc/HMOE3W6xHYs/jails.jpg">

<p>In this case, we are running multiple processes, but the kernel has been
modified to limit the resources that each process can affect or view. This
is the concept upon which jails are built: The name of the game is
process isolation and containment, not virtualization.</p>

<h2>The Details</h2>

<p>I'm going to skip over the details of how jails are created and what
that means from a data structure standpoint and skip straight to how to set
up a jail and how to use it. My examples will be from a fairly recent
development snapshot ("current," if you are familiar with FreeBSD
terminology) that is not yet a finished release, so some of the things I
will describe are not completely accurate to all versions of FreeBSD but the
concepts are the important part.</p>

<p>Jails have been around in FreeBSD for a long time now. They were first
introduced in <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/4.0R/notes.html">FreeBSD
  4.0</a> (10 years ago). Since that release, jails have been refined and
extended to support many of the things people want from them. Recent
releases of FreeBSD include the ability for IPv6, hierarchical jails,
resource utilization limits, and even virtual network stacks (which is out
of scope for this article).</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>For the purposes of this article, I'm going to use the term <i>host</i> to
indicate the FreeBSD base operating system upon which the jails will
run.</p>

<p>A jail only requires a handful of things in order to operate. The most
important of which is a working userland. Usually, people run the same
version of the userland inside a jail as the one that is running on the
host, but it doesn't have to be this way. If you want to run an older
userland in a jail, it will likely work because backwards compatibility in
the kernel is usually preserved.</p>

<p>Actually getting a working userland is outside of the scope of this
article. There are many ways to pick from: building your own, using your
existing install, or installing the binaries straight from release media.
The means of getting the binaries on disk is up to you. You also don't
need a full world (FreeBSD's term for the base OS), if you know exactly what
you are doing you can populate it with just what you need. There are also other
tricks you can do involving null mounting in other paths. For the purposes of
this article I've installed an exact copy of my host to /jails/test (minus any
package installations).</p>

<h2>Starting Jails</h2>

<p>With a world installed to <i>/jails/test</i>, I don't need anything else
installed in order to start a jail. Everything you need is provided by the
base FreeBSD install. Starting a jail manually is done using the jail(8)
command.</p>

<pre>
wxs@ack wxs % sudo jail /jails/test test 192.168.1.100 /bin/sh 
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),5(operator)
# 
</pre>

<p>The arguments to the jail command are pretty straight forward. It takes a
path where the root of the jail should live, a hostname, an IP address and a
command inside the jail to run. Once I'm inside the jail you can see that I
am automatically the root user.</p>

<p>From outside of the jail, on the host, you can use the jls(8) command to
list existing jails.</p>

<pre>
wxs@ack wxs % jls
   JID  IP Address      Hostname                      Path
     4  192.168.1.100   test                          /jails/test
wxs@ack wxs % 
</pre>

<p>The one catch is that while the jail says it has an IP address, the host
OS knows nothing about that IP address. In order to have your jail respond
to an IP address you must add it to a network interface by adding an alias:</p>

<pre>
wxs@ack wxs % sudo jail -r 4 # Kill existing jail, so it can get the new IP
wxs@ack wxs % sudo ifconfig bge0 alias 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.255
wxs@ack wxs % sudo jail /jails/test/ test 192.168.1.100 /bin/sh
#
</pre>

<p>And now inside our jail we can see that we have an IP address.</p>

<pre>
# ifconfig bge0 | grep inet
        inet 192.168.1.100 netmask 0xffffffff broadcast 192.168.1.100
# 
</pre>

<p>So, at this point, we just need a working devfs inside our jail and we
should have a normal, contained, system.</p>

<pre>
wxs@ack wxs % sudo mount -t devfs devfs /jails/test/dev
wxs@ack wxs % mount | grep jails
data/jails on /jails (zfs, local, noatime)
devfs on /jails/7/dev (devfs, local, multilabel)
devfs on /jails/test/dev (devfs, local, multilabel)
wxs@ack wxs % 
</pre>

<p>You might want your jail to be accessible from the network, so  let's run an
SSH daemon! I'll permit root logins for this jail, just to make my life easier,
but you can add users inside jails as normal. Also, be sure to set your root
password before you expose any network services. From the root shell you have after
running the jail(8) command, do this:</p>

<pre>
# sed -i '.bak' -e 's/^#PermitRootLogin no/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# /etc/rc.d/sshd onestart
[... Lots of output about host key generation ...]
# sockstat -4l | grep 22
root     sshd       61052 3  tcp4   192.168.1.100:22      *:*
# 
</pre>

<p>And outside the jail:</p>

<pre>
wxs@ack wxs % ssh root@192.168.1.100
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.100 (192.168.1.100)' can't be

FreeBSD ?.?.?  (UNKNOWN)

Welcome to FreeBSD!

[... MOTD ...]
test#
</pre>

<p>A keen eye would spot the weirdness '?.?.?' in the MOTD above. Normally that is
cleared up when the computer boots, but since we didn't really "boot" this
jail, that step never happened. Let's explore what it takes to get a jail to
start automatically upon boot.</p>

<h2>Booting Automatically</h2>

<p>One thing you must do when starting a jail is make sure the host services
are set to listen on only IP addresses that belong to the host, and not the
jail. Failure to do this will cause your host services to listen on IP
addresses that should be for the jail. This can have unintended consequences
such as exposing host services to places they shouldn't be. For now I'm
assuming you know how to do that.</p> 

<p>Like most things in FreeBSD they are controlled with settings in
<i>/etc/rc.conf</i>. There are actually a whole bunch of settings available,
but here's the simple set I'm using:</p>

<pre>
wxs@ack head % fgrep test /etc/rc.conf  
jail_list="test"
jail_test_rootdir="/jails/test"
jail_test_hostname="test"
jail_test_interface="bge0"
jail_test_ip="192.168.1.100"
jail_test_devfs_enable="YES"
wxs@ack head % 
</pre>

<p>Using this configuration, the 'test' jail will boot and start
automatically.</p>

<h2>Booting Manually</h2>

<p>You can use the <i>/etc/rc.d/jail</i> script to boot a jail manually
provided that the appropriate settings are set in <i>/etc/rc.conf</i>.
Another option is to set the IP address alias manually and mount devfs
manually then call /etc/rc yourself:</p>

<pre>
wxs@ack wxs % sudo jail -r 2 # Kill existing jail...
wxs@ack wxs % sudo jail /jails/test test 192.168.1.100 /bin/sh /etc/rc
/etc/rc: WARNING: $hostname is not set -- see rc.conf(5).

32-bit compatibility ldconfig path: /usr/lib32
Clearing /tmp (X related).

Sun Dec 12 16:16:37 UTC 2010
wxs@ack wxs % jls
   JID  IP Address      Hostname                      Path
     3  192.168.1.100   test                          /jails/test
wxs@ack wxs % 
</pre>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

<p>So if jails are all about isolation and containment, what can and what can't
you do inside a jail? The general rule of thumb is that if it affects the
host or other jails it is restricted by default. There are knobs you can
turn to allow these things, but in the interests of not breaking the security
model, they are turned off by default. Exactly what is restricted and what
knobs are available is highly dependent upon the version of FreeBSD you are
running. As more and more things are being designed to work better with jails,
the set of restricted operations is shrinking. For example, in earlier releases
root inside a jail was not allowed to change any network stack configuration
information. With the addition of virtualized network stacks in newer releases
of FreeBSD this restriction is gone, provided the jail is using a virtualized
stack.</p>

<p>For more information on this it is best to read the documentation
available.</p>

<h2>Trade offs</h2>

<p>Jails are a great way of getting "operating system level virtualization"
on FreeBSD, but like anything else, they come with a series of trade-offs
which must be considered prior to implementation.</p>

<p>A kernel level compromise does break the isolation provided by jails. In
a "platform virtualization" solution it would require a bug in the
hypervisor for that to happen. Jails are not necessarily any more or less
secure than a "platform virtualization" solution as it is going to come down
to implementation details. Bugs do happen in both worlds.</p>

<p>Another trade-off is that a jail can not emulate arbitrary hardware like
a VMM can. If you want to add a new virtual disk to your VM in a "platform
virtualization" solution it is a simple operation - the physical disk
doesn't really exist as it is just a file on the filesystem of the host. In
a jail you can not emulate arbitrary hardware.</p>

<p>As a jail is really just isolating processes from each other, it is
important to realize that root on the host has complete control over every
jail. This is an important thing to keep in mind when setting up a jail
environment. Root on the host should be trusted and controlled far more than
root in any of the jails.</p>

<p>Lastly, a user on the host can get access to things inside one of the
jails if the UIDs are the same. For example, on one of my hosts my UID is
1001, and inside one of the jails a different user (user1) has UID 1001.
From the viewpoint of user1, only he has access to his files inside the jail.
From my viewpoint, outside of the jail, the files are owned by me. The host
is going to use it's copy of /etc/passwd to determine ownership of files,
which means there can be overlapping information. This is another important
consideration to keep in mind when setting up a jail environment.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>

<p>There are many uses for jails. Lots of places use them to isolate web
hosting environments from each other, to provide root inside a contained
system for a customer, and to isolate developers from each other. I personally
use them to isolate test environments from each other. As a developer who
spends most of his time up in userland, this is a great solution to my need to
be able to quickly setup a clean test environment. As you spend more time with
jails, you begin to see different opportunities for application.</p>

<p>As more parts of FreeBSD become friendlier to jails you can start to
build very interesting things. Virtual network stacks, zfs, multi-IP jails,
hierarchical jails and many other things are fertile areas for exploration
as a systems administrator. As is often the case, the best way to get
familiar with jails is to dive in heads first!</p>
